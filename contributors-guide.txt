GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CODE BASE



OVERVIEW

* All development and testing is done on the 'dev' branch, the 'main' branch contains production-ready code that has been
  tested and optimized. The 'beta' branch is for releasing features that are still being tested.

* In the 'dev' branch, all source code is contained in the 'src' folder.

* In the 'dev' branch, build scripts are contained in the 'scripts' folder, and the major build tool is babel.

* The tests are contained in the 'tests' folder.

* The 'beta' folder contains the output of beta build, which is copied to the 'beta' branch and published.

* The 'prod' folder contains the output of the production build - which is the default build task - and is copied to the
  'main' branch for publishing.

* The project structure is described schematically in the 'structure.txt'.

* 'todo.txt' is the activity log, and 'README.md' contains the documentation for this package.

* 'node_modules' is deliberately being tracked by git to manage dev dependencies. Please do not add 'node_modules' to '.gitignore'. 


GETTING STARTED

to contribute to the code base, create a local branch on your PC from the dev branch. We assume you have cloned or
forked the repository from https://github.com/onepetercollins/app-state-utils
  
  (run: git branch myLocalDevBranch)

* After creating your local development branch, make it your active branch.

  (run: git branch myLocalDevBranch)

* Now you are in your local development branch.

* You can work on the source code in the 'src' folder here.

* You can create or modify build scripts in the 'scripts' folder.

* You can write or run tests by working in the 'tests' folder.

* You can add scripts to the package.json and you can add or remove dependencies.

* To test your code, you need to generate a production build or a beta build code by running one of the build scripts
  contained in the package.json.

* The production build output will be contained in the 'prod' folder on your local development branch.

* Beta build output will be contained in the 'beta' folder on your local development branch.

* The build process transpiles the source code contained in the 'src' folder from ES6+ to ES5 for backward compatibility
  and minifies it for optimal performance.


TESTING YOUR BUILD OUTPUT

* After creating a build, it is necessary to test and ensure your code works as intended.

* First copy your build output to another folder outside your working directory.

* Switch to the main or beta branch depending on what kind of build you want to test.

* Create a local branch from the main or beta directory.
  (run: git branch myLocalMainBranch) or (run: git branch myLocalBetaBranch)

* Make the newly created branch active.
  (run: git checkout myLocalMainBranch) or (run: git checkout myLocalBetaBranch)

* Now fetch your build output and paste it in this folder, make sure you overwrite any existing identical files.

* You can now copy and paste your working directory into the 'node_modules' folder of a project you can use to test the
  package.


SHARING YOUR SOLUTION

* Congratulations, if you have made it this far then you have come a long way. I want to assume you have made a contribution
  to the code base, and after some local testing you want to share your solution. In order to maintain the integrity of
  our package, you will be required to follow these guidelines if you don't have contributor access on the repository.

* If you created a new file/files or you modified existing ones, please write proper documentation where necessary.

* Include tags like @author, @fileoverview, @function, @param, @returns, etc in your files to help us understand what you have done.

* Create a patch file that captures all the changes you made to the code base as part of your solution.


CREATING A PATCH FILE

A patch file is a text file that helps us share code between our repositories.

* If you are satisfied with the changes you have made in 'myLocalDevBranch' you can now commit them.
  
  (run: git checkout myLocalDevBranch) - to switch to 'myLocalDevBranch'
  (run: git commit -m 'your new feature description') - to commit your changes in 'myLocalDevBranch'

* Proceed to create the patch file.

  if you have a single commit:
  (run: git format-patch HEAD~1 --stdout > patchfile.patch)

  if you have multiple commits, where n is the number of commits:
  (run: git format-patch HEAD~n --stdout > patchfile.patch)

* Send the patch file(s) with a short description of the issue solved to onepetercollins@gmail.com.

Cheers! hope to hear from you soon.
